## [🟩 Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- [x] Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`
- [x] Output: `[0, 1]`
- [x] Explanation: `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`

### **Two Pointers**
```python
# O(nlogn) Time | O(1) Space
def TwoSums(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    array.sort()
    while (left < right):
        sum = array[left] + array[right]
        if sum > target:
            right -= 1
        elif sum < target:
            left += 1
        elif sum == target:
            return [array[left], array[right]]
    return -1 
```
✅ **TWO POINTERS:** _Sort the array, use two pointers on each end of the array and move pointers based on comparison between sum and targetNum_

### **Hash Table**
```python
# O(n) time | O(n) space
def twoNumberSum(array, target): 
	nums = {}
	for num in array: 
		potentialMatch = target - num
		if potentialMatch in nums: 
			return [potentialMatch, num]
		else:
			nums[num] = True
	return []
```
✅ **HASH TABLE:** _Use hash map to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, don’t use same element twice_

## [🟩 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
>* You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
>* You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
>* Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- [x] Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- [x] Output: `5`
- [x] Explanation: 
  - `Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.`
  - `Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.`

### **Sliding Window**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space
def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
  if len(prices) <= 1:
      return 0
  buy_idx, sell_idx, min_idx, ans = 0, 1, 0, 0
  while sell_idx < len(prices):
      if prices[buy_idx] > prices[min_idx]:
          buy_idx = min_idx
      ans = max(ans, prices[sell_idx] - prices[buy_idx])
      if prices[sell_idx] < prices[min_idx]:
          min_idx = sell_idx
      sell_idx += 1
  return ans
```
✅ **SLIDING WINDOW:** _Find local min and search for local max using a sliding window_

---
## [🟩 Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
>* Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
>* A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

- [x] Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`
- [x] Output: `6`
- [x] Explanation: `[4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.`

### [**Divide and Conquer**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/discuss/1595195/C%2B%2BPython-7-Simple-Solutions-w-Explanation-or-Brute-Force-%2B-DP-%2B-Kadane-%2B-Divide-and-Conquer)
```python
# O(nlogn) Time | O(logn) Space
def maxSubArray(self, nums):
    def maxSubArray(A, L, R):
        if L > R: return -inf
        mid, left_sum, right_sum, cur_sum = (L + R) // 2, 0, 0, 0
        for i in range(mid-1, L-1, -1):
            left_sum = max(left_sum, cur_sum := cur_sum + A[i])
        cur_sum = 0
        for i in range(mid+1, R+1):
            right_sum = max(right_sum, cur_sum := cur_sum + A[i])
        return max(maxSubArray(A, L, mid-1), maxSubArray(A, mid+1, R), left_sum + A[mid] + right_sum)
    return maxSubArray(nums, 0, len(nums)-1)
```
✅ **DIVIDE AND CONQUER:** _pattern: prev subarray cant be negative, dynamic programming: compute max sum for each prefix_

>* Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

## [🟨 Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
>* Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.
>* An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```yaml
# Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]

>* You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>* The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.
>* Return the maximum **area** of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

## [🟨 River Sizes](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/River%20Sizes)
>* You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only `0`'s and `1`'s. Each `0` represents land, and each `1` represents part of a river. A river consists of any number of `1`'s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size.
>* Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or
a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.
>* Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented if the input
matrix. The sizes don't need to be in any particular order.

```yaml
Input: matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],

## [🟨 Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
> Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

- [x] Input: `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- [x] Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
- [x] Explanation: `Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].`

### **Sort, Check and Mutate**
```python
# O(nlogn) Time | O(n) Space
def mergeOverlappingIntervals(intervals):
    # Sorting the array of intervals based on the 1st elements of arrays
    sortedIntervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    mergedIntervals = []
    currentInterval = sortedIntervals[0] 
    mergedIntervals.append(currentInterval) # At least 1 interval is required for the algorithm to work
    
    for nextInterval in sortedIntervals:
        # Decomposing currentInterval into 2 variables (e.g.: currentInterval = [1, 2] gives _ = 1 and currentIntervalEnd = 2)
        _, currentIntervalEnd = currentInterval 
        # Decomposing nextInterval into 2 variables (e.g.: nextInterval = [3, 5] gives nextIntervalStart = 3 and nextIntervalEnd = 5)
        nextIntervalStart, nextIntervalEnd = nextInterval 
        
        # This check determines if two intervals are overlapping by comparing the intervalEnd value of the current interval is bigger or equal than the intervalStart value of the next interval
        if currentIntervalEnd >= nextIntervalStart:
            currentInterval[1] = max(currentIntervalEnd, nextIntervalEnd) # mutate the currentIntervalEnd to be the highest number between the intervalEnd values of the currentInterval and nextInterval
        else: 
            currentInterval = nextInterval # if there are no overlapping, then immediately append the interval to answer
            mergedIntervals.append(currentInterval)
            
    return mergedIntervals
```
✅ **SORT, CHECK AND MUTATE:** _Sort intervals by start values, compare end value and start value of adjacent intervals to check for overlap, mutate end value of answer interval to encapsulate merges, iterate checks for all intervals_
