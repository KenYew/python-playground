## [🟩 Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- [x] Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`
- [x] Output: `[0, 1]`
- [x] Explanation: `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`

### **Two Pointers**
```python
# O(nlogn) Time | O(1) Space
def TwoSums(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    array.sort()
    while (left < right):
        sum = array[left] + array[right]
        if sum > target:
            right -= 1
        elif sum < target:
            left += 1
        elif sum == target:
            return [array[left], array[right]]
    return -1 
```
✅ **TWO POINTER:** _Sort the array, use two pointers on each end of the array and move pointers based on comparison between sum and targetNum_

### **Hash Table**
```python
# O(n) time | O(n) space
def twoNumberSum(array, target): 
	nums = {}
	for num in array: 
		potentialMatch = target - num
		if potentialMatch in nums: 
			return [potentialMatch, num]
		else:
			nums[num] = True
	return []
```
✅ **HASH TABLE:** _Use hash map to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, don’t use same element twice_

## [🟩 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
>* You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
>* You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
>* Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- [x] Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- [x] Output: `5`
- [x] Explanation: 
  - `Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.`
  - `Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.`

### **Sliding Window**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space
def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
  if len(prices) <= 1:
      return 0
  buy_idx, sell_idx, min_idx, ans = 0, 1, 0, 0
  while sell_idx < len(prices):
      if prices[buy_idx] > prices[min_idx]:
          buy_idx = min_idx
      ans = max(ans, prices[sell_idx] - prices[buy_idx])
      if prices[sell_idx] < prices[min_idx]:
          min_idx = sell_idx
      sell_idx += 1
  return ans
```
✅ **SLIDING WINDOW:** _Find local min and search for local max using a sliding window_

## [🟨 Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)
>* Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

- [x] Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
- [x] Output: `[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]`
