## [ðŸŸ© Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- [x] Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`
- [x] Output: `[0, 1]`
- [x] Explanation: `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

### **Brute Force**
```python
# O(n^2) Time | O(1) Space
def TwoSums(array, target):
    for i in range(len(array) - 1): 
        firstNum = array[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(array)):
            secondNum = array[j]
            if firstNum + secondNum == targetSum:
                return [firstNum, secondNum]
    return []
```

### **Hash Table**
```python
# O(n) time | O(n) space
def twoNumberSum(array, target): 
	nums = {}
	for num in array: 
		potentialMatch = target - num
		if potentialMatch in nums: 
			return [potentialMatch, num]
		else:
			nums[num] = True
	return []
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **HASH TABLE:** _Use hash table to instantly check for difference value, map will add index of last occurrence of a num, donâ€™t use same element twice_

<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

# O(nlogn) Time | O(1) Space
def TwoSums(array, target):
    left = 0

## [ðŸŸ© Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
>* Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
>* A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

- [x] Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`
- [x] Output: `6`
- [x] Explanation: `[4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.`

### **Kadane's Algorithm** 
```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space
def maximumSubarraySum(self, arr):
    # 1: Initialise maxSum and currentSum
    maxSum = float("-inf")
    currentSum = 0

    # 2: Traverse through each value in the input array
    for val in arr:
        # 3: Add the new value of the current element to our currentSum
        currentSum = currentSum + val
        # 4: If currentSum is bigger than maxSum, update maxSum with the new bigger number from currentSum
        if currentSum > maxSum:
            maxSum = currentSum
        # 5: If currentSum is less than zero, update currentSum to zero

## [ðŸŸ© Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
>* You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
>* You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
>* Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- [x] Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
- [x] Output: `5`
- [x] Explanation: 
  - `Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.`
  - `Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.`

<img src="https://leetcode.com/media/original_images/121_profit_graph.png" width="500"  /><br/>
The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. We need to find the largest peak following the smallest valley. We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.

## [ðŸŸ© Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
> Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
- [x] Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`
- [x] Output: `true`
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

### **Brute Force**
```python
# O(n^2) Time | O(1) Space - where n is the length of the input
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        currentValue = nums[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            valueToCompare = nums[j]
            if currentValue == valueToCompare:
                return True
    return False
```
### **Hash Set**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(n) Space - where n is the length of the input
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set() # create a set which is an unordered collection of UNIQUE items
    for num in nums: # for every num in nums, we add to the set
        if num in seen: # but if we already find that num in the set, then we have a duplicate!
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

### **Space Optimized**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space - where n is the length of the input
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for num in nums: 
        absNum = abs(num)
        if nums[absNum - 1] < 0:
            return absNum
        nums[absNum - 1] *= -1
    return -1
```
### **One-Liner**
```python
# One-liner solution
def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
    return len(nums) > len(set(nums))
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **HASH SET:** _Use hash set to add and keep track of unique values in array, if value is seen in hash set, we found our duplicate_

## [ðŸŸ© Sorted Squared Array](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sorted%20Squared%20Array)
>* Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order.
>* Return a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
- [x] Input: `array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]`
- [x] Output: `[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]`
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

### **Two Pointers**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(n) Space - where n is the length of the input array
def sortedSquaredArray(array):
    # 1: Initialise output array of size input array with dummy values
    ans = [0 for _ in array]
    # 2: Initialise two pointers on each end of the array
    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1
    # 3: Traversing idx pointer from end to beginning of the array because we want to write the largest to the smallest values
    for idx in reversed(range(len(array))): 
        # 4: If abs(left-most value) is > abs(right-most value) e.g.: [-4, 1, 2]
        if abs(array[left]) > abs(array[right]):
            # 5: Insert the square of the largest value at the current iteration idx (from n-th to 0)
            ans[idx] = array[left] * array[left]
            # 6: Then, increment the left pointer
            left += 1
        # 7: Else if abs(right-most value) is >= abs(left-most value) e.g.: [1, 2, 3]
        else: 
            # 8: Insert the square of the largest value at the current iteration idx (from n-th to 0)
            ans[idx] = array[right] * array[right]
            # 9: Then, decrement the right pointer
            right -= 1
    # 10: Finally, return the sorted squared array
    return ans
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **TWO POINTERS:** _Initialise output array with 0's, and left and right pointers on each end of array. Traverse idx from end to beginning of the array, if abs(leftVal) > abs(rightVal), write the ans[idx] = leftVal ** 2 and increment left, else abs(rightVal) >= abs(leftVal), write the ans[idx] = rightVal **2 and decrement right._

## [ðŸŸ¨ Validate Subsequence](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Validate%20Subsequence)
>* Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
>* A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. 
>* For instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]` form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and so do
the numbers `[2, 4]`. 
>* Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
- [x] Input: `array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]`
- [x] Output: `true`
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

### **Two Pointers**
```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space - where n is the length of the array
def isValidSubsequence(array, sequence):
    # 1: Initialise pointers for both the input array and input sequence
    arrIdx = 0
    seqIdx = 0
    
    # 2: While we have not finished traversing both the input array and input sequence,
    while arrIdx < len(array) and seqIdx < len(sequence):
        
        # 3: If the current values in both array and seq match, increment the seqIdx to look for the next pair of equal numbers
        if array[arrIdx] == sequence[seqIdx]:
            seqIdx += 1

        # 4: Otherwise, increment arrIdx and keep traversing the array to look for next pair of equal numbers
        arrIdx += 1

    # 5: Once we have incremented seqIdx enough times, return the Boolean answer of whether the sequence is valid (only if seqIdx == len(sequence))
    return seqIdx == len(sequence)
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **TWO POINTERS:** _Initialise pointer for both input arrays (arr, seq). While both pointers have not fully traversed their arrays, if values from both array match, increment seqIdx, otherwise keep incrementing arrIdx. Return Boolean logic seqIdx == len(sequence)_

## [ðŸŸ¨ Array Of Products](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Array%20Of%20Products)
>* Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array of the same length, where each element in the output array is equal to the product of every other number in the input array.
>* In other words, the value at `output [i]` is equal to the product of every number in the input array other than `input[i]`.
>* Note that you're expected to solve this problem without using division.
- [x] Input: `array = [5, 1, 4, 2]`
- [x] Output: `[8, 40, 10, 20]`
- [x] Explanation:
```python
8 is equal to 1 x 4 x 2
40 is equal to 5 x 4 x 2
10 is equal to 5 x 1 x 2
20 is equal to 5 x 1 x 4
```
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

### **Brute Force**
```python
# O(n^2) Time | O(n) Space - where n is the length of the input array
def arrayOfProducts(array):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(array)):
        product = 1
        for j in range(len(array)):

>* Note that the absolute difference of two integers is the distance between them on the real number line. For example, the absolute difference of -5 and 5 is 10, and the absolute difference of -5 and -4 is 1.
>* You can assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

## [ðŸŸ¨ Move Element To End](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Move%20Element%20To%20End)
>* You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array.
>* The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.
- [x] Input: `array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], toMove = 2`
- [x] Output: `[4, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` or `[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`
### **Two Pointers**
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space - where n is the length of the input array
def moveElementToEnd(array, toMove):
    # 1: Initialise both left and right pointers of each end of the array
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    # 2: While both pointers have not fully traverse the array and pass each other,
    while left < right: 
        # 3: If the right pointer is on the value == toMoveNum, we keep decrementing the right pointer until it points to a number != toMoveNum
        while array[right] == toMove and left < right: # EDGE: left < right to ensure we don't keep decrementing the right pointer pass the left pointer and perform an accidental swap below
            right -= 1
        
        # 5: Finally, if left points to a value == toMoveNum (right would've pointed to a value != toMoveNum at this point), perform a swap
        if array[left] == toMove:
            array[left], array[right] = array[right], array[left]
        
        # 4: Then, keep moving the left pointer inward until value == toMoveNum
        left += 1
    return array
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **TWO POINTERS:** _Initialise two pointers (left & right) on each end. While left < right, nested while rightVal == toMoveNum, decrement right to ensure rightVal points to a swappable num != toMoveNum. Keep incrementing left. If leftVal == toMoveNum, perform swap._

### **Two Pointers - Order Preserved**
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>
<p>

```python
# O(n) Time | O(1) Space - where n is the length of the input array
def moveElementToEnd(array, toMove):
    readIdx, writeIdx = 0, 0
    while readIdx < len(array): 
        if array[readIdx] != toMove: 
            array[readIdx], array[writeIdx] = array[writeIdx], array[readIdx]
            writeIdx += 1
        readIdx += 1
    return array

def moveElementToEnd(array, toMove):
    writeIdx = 0
    for readIdx in range(len(array)): 
        if array[readIdx] != toMove: 
            array[readIdx], array[writeIdx] = array[writeIdx], array[readIdx]
            writeIdx += 1
    return array

Working through an example, say we have an array [1, 0, 2, 0, 3] and toMove = 0.
When read = 0, write = 0 and write += 1.
When read = 1, then array[read] == 0 and write = 1.
When read = 2, then we swap array[2] (read) and array[1] (write). The array is now [1, 2, 0, 0, 3] and write = 2.
When read = 3, array[read] == 0 and we skip.
When read = 4, then we swap array[4] (read) and array[2] (write). The final array is [1, 2, 3, 0, 0].
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **TWO POINTERS:** _Initialise two pointers (readIdx & writeIdx) at 0. Iterate through the array with readIdx, if `array[readIdx] != toMove`, swap `array[readIdx], array[writeIdx] = array[writeIdx], array[readIdx]` and increment `writeIdx += 1`, keep traversing array with `readIdx`, return mutated array_

## [ðŸŸ¨ Longest Peak](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Longest%20Peak)
>* Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest
peak in the array.
>* A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to form a peak.
>* For example, the integers `1, 4, 10, 2` form a peak, but the integers `4, 0, 10` don't and neither do the integers `1, 2, 2, 0`. Similarly, the integers `1, 2, 3` don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the `3`.
- [x] Input: `array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]`
- [x] Output: `6`
- [x] Explanation: `0, 10, 6, 5, -1 -3` form the longest peak
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

### **Two Pointers**
```python
# O(n) time | O(1) space  - where n is the length of the input array
def longestPeak(array):
    # 1: Initialise peakIdx pointer to be 1 (since we need at least one value to the left to evaluate a potential peak)
    longestPeakLength = 0
    peakIdx = 1

    # 2: While peakIdx has not fully traversed the array,
    while peakIdx < len(array) - 1: 

        # 3: Check previous and next values to see if current peakIdxValue forms a peak
        isPeak = array[peakIdx] > array[peakIdx - 1] and array[peakIdx] > array[peakIdx + 1]

        # 4: If they don't form a peak, keep incrementing peakIdx and skip current iteration
        if not isPeak: 
            peakIdx += 1
            continue

        # 5: Else if current peakIdxValue does form a peak, let's evaluate how long is the peak.

        # 6: For the left side of the peak, set the leftIdx to point to the subsequent previous value (peakIdx - 2) and then perform a while loop that keeps decrementing the leftIdx if the previous values are consecutively decreasing
        leftIdx = peakIdx - 2
        while leftIdx >= 0 and array[leftIdx + 1] > array[leftIdx]: # traverse until leftIdx = 0
            leftIdx -= 1

        # 7: For the right side of the peak, set the rightIdx to point to the subsequent next value (peakIdx + 2) and then perform a while loop that keeps incrementing the rightIdx if the next values are consecutively increasing
        rightIdx = peakIdx + 2
        while rightIdx < len(array) and array[rightIdx - 1] > array[rightIdx]: # traverse until rightIdx = len(array) - 1
            rightIdx += 1
            
        # 8: Evaluate the total length of the peak by using the difference between the two pointers (accounting for zero-indexing)
        currentPeakLength = rightIdx - leftIdx - 1

        # 9: Evaluate only the MAX between the longestPeakLength (from previous iteration) and currentPeakLength (current iteration)
        longestPeakLength = max(longestPeakLength, currentPeakLength) 

        # 10: Update the peakIdx to be the right-most index. This is will be the new starting point to look for the next peak as we keep traversing the array.
        peakIdx = rightIdx
        
    return longestPeakLength
```
</p>
</details>

âœ… **TWO POINTERS:** 
1. Intialise peakIdx to traverse the array and find a potential peak.
2. If peak is found, set leftIdx and rightIdx to be peakIdx - 2 and peakIdx + 2 to. 
3. Decrement leftIdx in a while loop if previous values are consecutively decreasing.
4. Increment rightIdx in a while loop if next values are consecutively increasing. 
5. Evaluate currentPeakLength by calculating the difference between leftIdx and rightIdx. 
6. Update peakIdx to be rightIdx to find the next potential longest peak. 
7. Return max(longestPeakLength, currentPeakLength)
